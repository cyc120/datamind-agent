"""Kernel-unified plugin handler invocation: one call site, one attribution vocabulary.

A parser handler is third-party code, and a caller that invokes it in several places ends up
with several answers to the same two questions: which HTTP error does a broken handler
become, and which plugin does the log line name? :func:`invoke_plugin` answers both once,
which is why ``ingestion.upload_pipeline`` never calls a loader directly any more.

Two rules shape it:

*importing this module is standard library only (G2)*
    ``fastapi`` is imported inside the exception path only, never at module top, so
    importing this module pulls no web framework, and a listing endpoint cannot drag one in
    through a plugin import. (Turning a failure into an ``HTTPException`` does require
    fastapi - a runtime dependency of the application - but only the import of this module
    is stdlib-only.)

*passthrough is not a failure*
    A plugin that raises ``HTTPException`` has deliberately refused the input and already
    named its own stable code (G12); that exception is re-raised unchanged, so the contract
    error the caller sees is exactly the one the plugin raised. It is logged with
    ``reason='passed_through'``: a deliberate refusal, neither a success nor a crash.
    Everything else is mapped onto ``PARSE_ADAPTER_UNSUPPORTED``: an ``ImportError``
    (including ``ModuleNotFoundError``) means an optional parser library is absent and is
    reported as ``reason='library_missing'``, any other ``Exception`` as
    ``reason='handler_failed'``. ``library_missing`` covers imports raised *inside* the
    handler; a loader declared as an import string whose module cannot be imported at all
    fails earlier, because ``manifest.resolve()`` reports it as
    ``ManifestError(PARSE_RESULT_INVALID, reason='unresolvable_loader')`` before this
    wrapper runs. The original error stays attached as ``__cause__``. ``KeyboardInterrupt``
    and ``SystemExit`` are not the plugin's failure to report, so only ``Exception`` is
    caught.

The log record is the attribution channel: every invocation emits ``plugin``,
``media_type``, ``reason`` (one of ``ok``, ``passed_through``, ``library_missing``,
``handler_failed``) and ``duration_ms``, and the HTTP body never carries exception text - a
message that quotes a str(error) can leak paths, connection secrets or SQL.

Example::

    from datamind.plugin.invocation import invoke_plugin

    # path, document_id, source_version and options are the upload handler's own four
    # arguments; the wrapper forwards them untouched.
    result, extra = invoke_plugin(manifest, manifest.resolve(), path, document_id,
                                  source_version, options)

The ``(result, extra)`` tuple above is the *upload handler's* return shape, not the
wrapper's: :func:`invoke_plugin` returns whatever the loader returned, unchanged, so a
handler returning one object yields that object.
