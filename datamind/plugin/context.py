"""Cordis-style plugin context: services, injection, reversible effects, disposal.

This is a Python-native kernel with Cordis' *semantics*, not its API: there is no npm
``cordis``, no Node process and no sidecar (G1), and nothing here imports anything
outside the standard library (G2). The differences from npm cordis are deliberate:

* everything is synchronous; ``await``-based cordis dispatchers map onto the
  :class:`~datamind.plugin.events.EventBus` methods (``emit``/``parallel``/``serial``/
  ``waterfall``/``bail``);
* services are reached with ``ctx.get(name)`` or attribute access (``ctx.parser``),
  not through JavaScript property proxies;
* ``inject`` is explicit and never silently postponed: a plugin whose declared
  dependencies are missing fails its load with :class:`InjectError` instead of waiting.

The three ideas that matter downstream:

*reversible effects*
    Every mutation (service registration, event listener, arbitrary cleanup) is applied
    together with a disposer and recorded through :meth:`Context.effect`. Disposal runs
    the disposers in reverse order, so a context is a stack of undo actions.

*scoped loading*
    :meth:`Context.plugin` applies a plugin on a fresh child context. A successful load
    leaves the child attached to its parent; a failed load disposes the child, which
    rolls back exactly the effects that load applied and nothing else.

*shared surface, per-plugin ownership*
    Services and events are stored on the root context and therefore visible to
    everyone, while the *disposers* that remove them belong to the loading context. That
    is what makes unloading a plugin remove its services and listeners while the rest of
    the application keeps running.

    Absent optional fields without a default are left out of the result rather than set
    to ``None``, so "was it configured?" stays answerable. Unknown fields are rejected:
    a typo in a plugin config must not be silently ignored. Every failure raises
    :class:`ConfigError` whose ``path`` names the offending field, e.g. ``config.retries``
    (pass ``path='plugins.pdf.config'`` to prefix it with the plugin).

    With ``schema=None`` the config passes through as a shallow copy (or ``{}`` for
    ``None``), which is what a plugin without a schema expects. Nested schemas are out of
    scope for the kernel: Task 2 composes flat schemas per plugin.
