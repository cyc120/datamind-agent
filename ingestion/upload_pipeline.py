"""Upload -> staged bytes -> durable parse queue -> contract store -> review gate.

One call (`create`) stages the raw body, registers the `document_assets` row and queues a
durable parse job; parsing runs asynchronously and writes the unified parse contract with
`ingestion.contract_store.persist_result`. A successfully parsed upload is **never
retrievable**: the asset keeps `needs_review=TRUE` and a non-`indexed` status until an
explicit `approve` action clears the gate.

Why this is not the `file_jobs` queue
-------------------------------------
`file_jobs` is the durable queue for staged DXF/measurement *registrations*, and its two
targets are reused here in spirit: the DXF branch parses through `ingestion.cad_adapter`
(the adapter both CAD paths share) and the JSON branch validates through
`datamind.cad_dimensions.measurement_from_bytes` (the parser behind the existing
measurement target). The queue itself lives in the pre-existing `ingest_jobs` table
because:

* `file_job_items.kind` is `CHECK(kind IN ('drawing','measurement'))` (migration 010), so
  an Office/PDF parse cannot be queued there without a new migration, and this change is
  not allowed to add one;
* neither `cad_store.register` nor `cad_dimensions.register_measurement` writes the
  unified contract store or a `document_assets` row, which the upload contract requires.

The runner is the same bounded-process/deadline mechanism (`datamind.task_budget`), and a
claim is fenced by the row's own `queued -> running -> terminal` transition with
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` **and** by the claim generation (`claim_token`/`attempt`, R04);
a crashed worker's stale `running` row is reclaimable after `stale_running_seconds()`.

Claim generations (R04)
-----------------------
A row transition is not an identity: the same bytes re-uploaded are the same `job_id`, so
"still `running`" can be true for *two* different claims. Every claim therefore stamps
`ingest_job_claims.claim_token` with a fresh random value and increments
`ingest_job_claims.attempt` in the same transaction (migration 018; the generation lives in
its own table because `ingest_jobs` is owned by `postgres` and cannot be altered by the
`datamind_app` migration role). All claim-dependent writes — the contract result,
`quality_detail`, the terminal status and the wave-timeout counter — re-check that token
under `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and commit **nothing** when it no longer matches:

* `run_parse` parses outside any transaction, then does
  `lock + token check -> persist_result -> quality_detail -> terminal status` in **one**
  transaction, so an old claim can neither leave half a result nor a wrong terminal state;
* a re-upload of a `running` job does **not** reset it (no new generation is opened and
  the current one is returned as-is); a terminal job is re-armed to `queued` and the next
  claim opens the next generation.

A worker is the clock
---------------------
A job advances **only when something calls the worker**:

* `ingestion.upload_worker` (`python -m ingestion.upload_worker --watch|--once`) is that
  caller; it reuses `work_once`/`drain` and publishes a heartbeat in `task_leases`;
* `GET /v1/uploads/{upload_id}` is a **pure read** — it reports the truth but never
  advances anything;
* `GET /v1/uploads` (the list) is read-only too, and additionally reports
  `worker.alive`/`worker.last_seen_at` so a client can honestly say "后台处理器未运行"
  instead of showing a `queued` job as "解析中";
* with no worker running, a job stays `queued` forever (that is a deployment fact, not a
  parse failure).

Every parse runs in a bounded child process (`task_budget.run_bounded`); nothing parses
inline in the API process unless a caller explicitly passes `in_process=True` (tests and a
worker that already owns a disposable process).

Honesty rules enforced here
---------------------------
* `vector_index` reports what really happened to the index, never a claim: `embedded`
  once the parse wave has written this document's `chunks` rows and Qdrant points
  (`ingestion/upload_index.py`), `failed` when indexing was attempted and did not
  complete, and `deferred` when there was nothing to index. The index is **not** the
  review gate: `embedded` still means "not retrievable" until an administrator approves.
* Retrievability is **derived, never stored** (R05): every item carries
  `searchable = (status == 'indexed') and not needs_review and chunk_count > 0`, plus the
  reason as `index_state` (`indexed`/`no_chunks`/`not_approved`) and `index_note`.
  `approve` clears the review gate, but it only marks the asset `indexed` when the chunk
  store the retriever actually reads (`datamind.knowledge` reads `chunks` only) is
  non-empty. A contract with blocks is evidence, not an index.
* A parse result the contract refuses is stored as a stable `error_code`, never as a
  successful empty document; an explicit contract gap (`unsupported_features`) is carried
  through into the summary the `/contract` endpoint repeats.
